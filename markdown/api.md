# LS API Documentation

This page documents how to access LS provided functionality.

## Resource Overview

Structured representation of the Lobby Service's REST resources and offered access methods:

![rif](images/ls-api.png)

Quick navigation:

 * [/api/online](#online)
 * [/api/users](#users) and subresource
 * [/api/gameservice](#game-services) and subresource
 * [/api/sessions](#sessions) and subresource
 * [/api/gameservices/{gameservice}/savegames](#savegames) and subresource
 * [/oauth](#authentication) and subresources

## ARC Configuration

The "[Advanced Rest Client](https://install.advancedrestclient.com/install)" is a tool for convenient REST API test access and code generators for various programming languages. All major platforms and [a browser plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo) are supported.

 * Prepared ARC filed can be download in the individual sections below. View as RAW and safe to a ```*.arc``` file on your disk.
 * To import an ARC file, open the ARC program, then use the ```File -> Import Data...``` menu. Then select your ARC file.

## Access Details

The remainder of this page lists detailed endpoint descriptions of all LS resources.  
The following syntax is used:

 * Methods that require full authentication by OAuth2-token are printed **bold**.
 * Optional URL-, Header- or Body-parameters are printed *italic* 

 > **Note**: OAuth2 tokens often contain one or multiple "```+```" signs. If you transmit an OAuth2 token via URL-encoding, e.g. for method authentication, you must escape all occurrences of ```+``` to the URL-encoded representation: ```%2B```. Otherwise your token is not recognized and the associated request will be answered with a [```403``` (forbidden) HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403).

        }
        ```  
        *Note: If the server registration occurred in phantom (p2p) mode, the location string is empty. Instead, the location of all clients is then maintained per session.*
   * **PUT**: Registers a new Game-Service at the LS.
     * Request-Parameters: ```access_token=...``` (service role required)
     * Header-Parameters: ```Content-Type: application/json```
     * Request-Body:  
        ```json

Furthermore the Lobby-Service will suppress all outbound notifications to the phantom game-server. Clients can observe the session status with async update requests on the individual sessions instead.*
     * Curl:  
        ```
        curl -X PUT --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"name":"DummyGame1","displayName":"Dummy Game 1","location":"http://127.0.0.1:4243/DummyGameService","minSessionPlayers":3,"maxSessionPlayers":5, "webSupport":"true"}' http://127.0.0.1:4242/api/gameservices/DummyGame1?access_token=dA/1to5bFiRvqTem0eiUzY2FITw=

### Authentication

[[Download sample ARC configuration](arc/ls-oauth2.arc)]

 * /oauth/token
   * ```POST```: Creates, registers and returns a new OAuth2-Token and a corresponding Renew-Token.
     * Request-Parameters: ```grant_type=password```, ```username=...```, ```password=...```
     * Alternative Request-Parameters (token renewal): ```grant_type=refresh_token```, ```refresh_token=...```
     * Authentication: ```bgp-client-name:bgp-client-pw```
     * Curl:  
        ```
        curl -X POST --user bgp-client-name:bgp-client-pw "http://127.0.0.1:4242/oauth/token?grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin"
        ```  
        alternatively you can pass the credentials as body data. (Body encoding follows urlencoded syntax. This means any plus sign occurrences in the password string must still be escaped to ```%2B```):  
        ```
        curl -X POST --user bgp-client-name:bgp-client-pw --data "grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin" "http://127.0.0.1:4242/oauth/token"
